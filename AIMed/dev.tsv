AIMed.d2.s24.p3	N	RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar PROTEIN1 : PROTEIN ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in PROTEIN : PROTEIN ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar PROTEIN2 : PROTEIN ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.
